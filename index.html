                        <p class="jakt">These wise words by Rumi make us believe that love is a passionate feeling, which either gives you the power to fight against anything or destroys you in the most beautiful way. Either way, you still tend to stay in love. 

                            Being in love is like living in a different world altogether. It's a roller coaster ride of emotions, a crazy feeling which gives you an adrenaline rush as soon as you look at the person you love, and a world in which two people share their lives, souls and everything in between.
